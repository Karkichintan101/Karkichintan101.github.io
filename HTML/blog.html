				<h3>Impact of Technology</h3>
				2020<br>Nepal<br><br>
				<p><a href="https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/technology" target="_blank">Oxford Dictionary</a>
					defines technology as "The application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in
					the industry."
					The word technology has its root from greek word 'techne' which generally means 'craft'.
					Essentially, any innovation, crafts , creation of tools or techniques is what makes a 'Technology'.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>The word 'Technology' first appeared in the English dictionary in the 17th century.
					But the process of technological innovation has been going on since the origin of humanity itself.
					Even 'Australopithecus' crafted sharp stones and hammers nearlu 3.3 million years ago.
					Fire was one of the biggest innovation ever by 'Homo erectus' nearly 1.5 million years ago.
					With the advent of Neolithic era (20,000 to 15,000 years ago) several key technologies came into
					work
					such as Potteries, Agriculture , fabrics/clothes and Wheel. Some world changing technologies being
					Irrigation (started in 6000 BCE) , Sailing (in 4000 BCE),
					Iron production (in 1200 BCE), Medchanical clock (in 1250s), Printing (in mid 1400s).
					But the main era of technological revolution came in 18th century with the advent of Industrial
					Revolution.
					Some of the noticeable innovations of this period being Steam engine (in 1765 BCE),
					Railways (in 1804), Photography (in 1827), Telephone (in 1876), Combustion Engine(in 1876), Electric
					bulb(in 1879),
					Automobiles (in 1885),etc. .
					<br><br>
					<p>
						Technology is dynamic. It changes repidly in an exponential manner. With the turn of new century
						(i.e. 21st),
						the traditional definition has been redefined. The technological innovations in this era are
						more consumer
						focused than ever before. Technologies have a great impact in todays world. Technologies (which
						millenials
						like to call "Tech"), have made life very efficient and convenient. Technologies like Internet,
						Mobile phones ,
						etc have changed the way we communicate. The world has become a global village. One can connect
						with another person
						in different corner of world in a matter of seconds. Technologies in medical fields have led to
						effective treeatment
						of so-called harsh deseases. Engineering revolutions has made inter-planetory travel possible.
						Humans have been able to
						leave a very noticeable mark to not only earth but the universe itself.

					</p><br>
					<p>
						Positive impacts of technological advancement seems to be very impowering. But there is
						a very dark side to all of these innovations. As in the biggest clashes of World-War I, and
						World-War II
						we came across the highest level of technological misuse. Use of mechanical, chemical and
						engineering technologies
						were pulled toward the dark sides which led to deaths and destructions of millions. Ill intent
						of ane evil could
						lead to the unimaginable with these technologies. Even now, several terrorist organisations are
						using the technologies
						for very ill purposes. Even common technologies are affecting the ecological state of the globe.
						CO2 emissions, CFCs,
						radiation interferences, etc are some of the unseen effects of technologies that cause a very
						noticeable change to the
						world.

					</p><br>
					<p>
						Innovative technologies have been used in the upliftment of various aspects of the globe.
						Though, there are times when it has downlifted as well. Consciousness towards green
						planet is increasing. Technologies have also led in the conservations. But, Its necessary that
						people have proper awareness about the use of technology in sustainable and harmless manner.
						With times , lets hope that consiousness towards humanity increases and nuclear attacks, wars,
						etc would be
						things of the past.
